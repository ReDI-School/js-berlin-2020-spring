### Practicing with Functions, Arrays and Objects

For this lesson we will together complete 3 practice tasks. We will be split into small groups so that you can ask questions to the teacher in your class.

Each task will have a 5 min introduction, 20 min to complete the task in the breakout rooms and 10 min for a demonstration of the solutions.

These are meant to be simple use cases for automating manual business activity
